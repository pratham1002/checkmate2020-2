# CHECKMATE-2020

Checkmate has been a semesterly tradition conducted by BITS-ACM, unforutunately this Checkmate, because of COVID-19 has to be held online. This year's Checkmate consists a bunch of PvP frontend games and a vibrant Unity Single player maze filled with riddles, puzzling minigames, and some enemies ;) so watch out.

## Overview

Checkmate2020 has been filled with puzzles, riddles and head to head games. At the start of the game you spawn into a maze, filled with different logical minigames and puzzles. You have to traverse this maze on your own accord, and maximize the amount of points you gather. Small frontend based games will pop up from time to time and you will be redirected to those. Here you would have to fight against time or against a different player altogether

## Frontend based games

### Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

This version of Tic-Tac-Toe consists of a 3x3 grid of 3x3 grids, where you go head to head against another player. Both the players take turns playing in smaller grids until one player wins with respect to the huge grid.

### Mastermind

You are given a time of 5 minutes and in that time you have to correctly decode the color combination, while getting continous feedback from the game itself.

### Chain reaction

Chain-reaction is a strategy based multiplayer board game with the objective of taking control of entire board by eliminating the opponent's orbs. Players take turns to place their orbs in a cell on the board. Once a cell has reached certain 'critical' mass(2/3/4 orbs depending upon the position of the cell) the orbs explode into the surrounding cells adding an extra orb and capture the cell and all the contained orbs for the player. A player may only place their orbs in a blank cell or a cell that contains orbs of their own color. As soon as a player loses all their orbs they lose the game and the opponent wins.

## The Maze

This maze was modelled in Blender and the environment along with the interactables was made in Unity. 

### Checkers

You start with a blank slate, where all the buttons are green, clicking on a button will turn the button and its neighbors red, and that is the whole objectove of the game, to turn each button red.

### Enemy AI

The enemy NPC will chase you if you are in its line of sight, and will shoot you (like every good enemy does). The only way you can escape is running quick enough, or dodging. Whatever suits your style.

### Mask-Room

MYSTERY. CAN'T ELABORATE.

### Tetris

As the name suggests, its Tetris, but with wind, so if your block is moving in a random direction, its not a bug, its a feature, and it is your job to make full use of that feature :)

### Mirror Game

There are 5 mirrors, 15 sliders and two points. You have to reflect the light off every mirror exactly once and make the ray reach from the start point to the end point.
